## The STEMPrime and TerraPrime Simulations


### As of now, all of the preliminary algorithmic work is being completed in a series of private Jupyter Notebooks.
### I expect that the first attempt to collect and connect all of the varying pieces will not begin until sometime around the turn of 2021 (six to nine months from 2020.04)


The STEMPrime and TerraPrime simulations are the first step in the last phase of our research efforts to find out whether or not STEM Theory holds water.

The goal here is not to find out whether or not the STEM Epiconomy is a viable social structure.

The idea of an epiconomy (specifically this, the STEM-based epiconomy), unfortunately is not something that can be fully tested until the first few prototypes of the actual AI STEM Drive have been developed and debugged.

Only then can we construct a "test-bed city" (or some other, smaller implementation), and test it with a population of actual free-thinking individuals.

Even though the theory is sound (based on the modern revisions and interpretations of Maslow's conceptual idea of Self-Actualization, The Self-Determination Theory of Motivation specifically and other aspects of psychology and sociology), when assembled in such a manner as has never before been tested; caution is necessary.

STEM Theory is the idea that a network (which, in all honesty, could easily run atop our current world-wide internet infrastructure with the exception of some small, yet significant per-household alterations) of artificial learning agents might be all that is needed to support the pre-defined STEM Epiconomy.

I am considering D-Wave as a means for calculating the enormous amount of maximization and minimization problems inherent in such a network as this.

[The STEMPrime Researchcast](https://anchor.fm/stemprime/) is to coincide with the development of these simulations.
