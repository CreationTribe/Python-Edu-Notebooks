## The STEMPrime and TerraPrime Simulations


### As of now, all of the preliminary algorithmic work is being completed in a series of private Jupyter Notebooks.
### I expect that the first attempt to collect and connect all of the varying pieces will not begin until sometime around the turn of 2021 (six to nine months from 2020.04)


The STEMPrime and TerraPrime simulations are the first step in the last phase of our research efforts to find out
whether or not STEM Theory holds water.

The goal here is not to find out whether or not the STEM Epiconomy is a viable social structure.

The idea of an epiconomy (specifically this, the STEM-based epiconomy), unfortunately is not something that can be
fully tested until the first few prototypes of the actual AI STEM Drive have been developed and debugged.

Only then can we construct a "test-bed city" (or some other, smaller implementation), and test it with a population of
actual free-thinking individuals.

Even though the theory is sound (based on the modern revisions and interpretations of Maslow's conceptual idea of
Self-Actualization, The Self-Determination Theory of Motivation, and several other less prominent aspects of psychology
and sociology such as the organizational use of the Dunbar Number), when assembled in such a manner as has never before
been tested; caution is necessary.

STEM Theory is the idea that a network (which, in all honesty, could easily run atop our current world-wide internet
infrastructure with the exception of some small, yet significant per-household alterations) of artificial learning
agents might be all that is needed to support the pre-defined STEM Epiconomy.

## Tentatively Entertained Technologies

I am considering [D-Wave](https://dwavesys.com/) as a means for calculating the enormous amount of maximization and minimization problems
inherent in such a network as this. D-Wave, thus far, seems to be the most proactively engaged quantum computing 
platform. That, and the fact that they have granted Phobos Technologies limited use to their systems has cemented
their computers as being our foremost choice.

[Nupic](https://github.com/numenta/nupic) has won its place for the more abstract functions of The AI STEM Drive. 
The reason being is that Nupic is the only ML library that utilizes HTM theory. Based wholly on an in-depth analysis
of the neocortex and the temporal nature of biological neural networks; Nupic is the only library capable of executing
the temporally sensitive requirements of The AI STEM Drive.

[TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) and [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/): both being exceptional choices
for AI/ML work as well as already being familiar with these platforms; are the current libraries in use for the sims.

[The STEMPrime Researchcast](https://anchor.fm/stemprime/) is to coincide with the development of these simulations.
